    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or as neede</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat convection oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from pan. Pour water into the pan, while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add more water if needed to dislodge the browned bits; serve alongside chicken.</li>
    </ol>
